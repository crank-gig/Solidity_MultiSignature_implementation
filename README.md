# MultiSignature Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract implements a simple multi-signature wallet, allowing multiple owners to jointly manage and execute transactions. The contract supports adding, removing, and replacing owners, as well as submitting and confirming transactions. Transactions can be executed only when the required number of confirmations is reached.

## Contract Details

### Owners

- The contract is initialized with a list of initial owners.
- Owners can be added, removed, or replaced by other owners.

### Confirmations

- Owners can confirm or revoke their confirmation for a specific transaction.
- Transactions require a minimum number of confirmations to be executed.

### Transactions

- Owners can submit transactions to the contract, specifying the destination, value, and data.
- Each transaction must be confirmed by the required number of owners before execution.
- Executed transactions trigger an `Execution` event with the outcome (success or failure).

## Usage

### Add Owner

```solidity
function addOwner(address newOwner) external onlyOwner_
```
Adds a new owner to the list of owners.

### Remove Owner

```solidity
function removeOwner(address ownerToRemove) external onlyOwner_
```
Removes an owner from the list of owners. Ensures the required confirmations won't be compromised.


### Replace Owner

```solidity
function replaceOwner(address ownerToRemove, address newOwner) external onlyOwner_
```
Replaces an existing owner with a new one.

### Confirm Transaction

```solidity
function confirmTransaction(uint256 transactionId) external onlyOwner_ notConfirmed(transactionId) notExecuted(transactionId)
```
Confirms a transaction. If the required confirmations are met, the transaction is executed.


### Revoke Confirmation

```solidity
function revokeConfirmation(uint256 transactionId) external onlyOwner_ confirmed(transactionId) notExecuted(transactionId)
```
Revokes a previously confirmed transaction.



### Execute Transaction

```solidity
function executeTransaction(uint256 transactionId) internal notExecuted(transactionId)
```
Executes a confirmed transaction.


### Submit Transaction

```solidity
function submitTransaction(address destination, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner_ returns (uint256 transactionId)
```
Submits a new transaction to the contract. If the required confirmations are met, the transaction is executed.



## Requirements
- The contract ensures that the required number of confirmations is valid.
- Confirmations and executions are tracked for each transaction.
